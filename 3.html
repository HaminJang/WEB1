    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
    technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
    client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
